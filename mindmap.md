#### Text mining allows generation of new information through analysis of large bodies of text or data <aside>Time taken to extract useful information from sources can be reduced

### Avoid duplication of efforts

## Enablement

### Development of new products, services, companies

### Mandatory data disclosure requirements leads to strategic delays in publication

## Quality
  
### Pre-registration of study design and protocol
  
### Open peer review
