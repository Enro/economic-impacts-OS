# Economic impacts of open science

## Efficiency <!--fold -->

### Access cost savings <!--fold -->

#### Save cost of journal subscriptions

##### SMEs spend a smaller budget on subscriptions than larger companies

##### University collaborations help with journal access

#### Typically no cost of access to data

##### Willingness to pay

##### Willingness to accept

#### Transaction costs savings

##### Avoid material transfer agreements

##### Avoid negotiating intellectual property

###### Reduce uncertainty

###### Save negotiation costs

###### E.g. text and data mining

### Labour cost savings <!--fold -->

#### Time spent accessing research outputs

#### Time spent exchanging data

### Productivity improvements <!--fold -->

#### Text and data mining allows generation of new information through analysis of large bodies of text or data <aside>Time taken to extract useful information from sources can be reduced
  
#### Access to more complete information diminishes ignorance

#### Avoid duplication of efforts

## Enablement <!--fold -->

### Development of new products, services, companies

### Collaborations
  
#### e.g. pre-competitive multi-stakeholder collaborative research 

### Permitting work

#### i.e. research that would not otherwise have been possible
  
### Democratization of scientific knowledge
  
#### Research questions are better informed by societal needs <aside>Diversity and plurality in scientific participation could facilitate the identification of problems
  
#### Marginal groups are empowered to solving their problems

#### Nurtures cheaper, open (rather than for profit) solutions

## Quality <!--fold -->
  
### Validation of research outputs <!--fold -->
  
#### Open peer review
  
#### Post-publication peer review
  
### Less biased, more honest reporting <!--fold -->
  
#### Pre-registration of study design and protocol
  
### More reproducible research <!--fold -->
    
#### Open data
  
#### Open source research software
  
### Creative research from diverse contributors <!--fold -->
  
#### Crowdsourcing
  
#### Unconventional thinking
    
## Costs and challenges <!--fold -->
  
### The social benefits of open science are greater than the individual benefits
  
#### The individual (administrative) costs may be high
  
##### Less rewards than commercialization
  
### Backfire effect

#### Mandatory data disclosure requirements leads to strategic delays in publication
