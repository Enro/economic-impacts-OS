# Difficulties

## Sponsors and funders

Sponsors and third parties may enter into an agreement that overrides the policy. `IP Policy`

At all times, researchers are expected to act in accordance with the expectations of those funding the research, and with the minimum thresholds set by regulatory bodies. `Open Science Statement`

## Joint ownership with students

[In case] The IP is jointly created with other researchers or its creation is dependent on other University IP […] they [the students] may be required to assign the IP to the University or place the results in the public domain. `IP Policy`

## Citizen science and crowdsourcing

The Principal Investigator must ensure that any visitors or other non-University employees
working on a project do not compromise any obligations to third parties and consider putting in place appropriate agreements. `IP Policy`

# Easefulness

## Priority rights

The University has the initial right to apply for an invention patent or
other IP right. `IP Policy`

## Delegation

The Head of Department or their authorised delegate may authorise the release of
copyright so-owned by the University under Open Source rules or similar arrangements. `IP Policy`

CE [Cambrige Enterprise] and the creators will jointly decide whether or not to pursue commercialisation of the idea and the type of IP protection required. `IP Policy`

The University supports the academic freedom of researchers to pursue new knowledge, and to choose the means of dissemination; but within that free choice, the University encourages outputs of research, and where appropriate the accompanying data, to be ‘as open as possible, as closed as necessary’. `Open Science Statement`
