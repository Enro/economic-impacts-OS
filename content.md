## Mindmap

40' : create a [collaborative mindmap](https://mymarkmap.vercel.app/#https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Enro/economic-impacts-OS/main/mindmap.md) on the economic impacts of open science

What students produced in 2022 : <img src="Mindmap.png" />

## Case studies

40' : in groups, investigate some case studies of open science outputs and their economic impacts and [fill a template](https://github.com/Enro/economic-impacts-OS/blob/main/template.md)
* [Vidjil](https://www.vidjil.net/) (hematology and immunology)
* [RISC-V](https://riscv.org/) (microprocessor design)
* [syringe pump](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02119548/)
* Landsat satellite images ([source 1](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2001682117) and [source 2](https://www.unoosa.org/pdf/pres/stsc2012/2012ind-05E.pdf))

20' : break

30' : share the investigations with the other groups

## Problem solving

50' : in groups, read through the [IP Policy](https://www.enterprise.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IP-Policy-in-Practice-Guidance-Note-25May10-FINAL-CLEAN-Updated-links-August-2015.pdf) and the [Open Science Statement](https://osc.cam.ac.uk/open-research-position-statement) of the University of Cambridge.

After studying the texts, identify the institutional barriers of research organizations trying to balance commercialization of research and open science, and explain how you would tackle the issue in your research organization or research lab. [Not everything in the IP Policy and the Open Science statement conflicts with each other](problem-solving.md). So you may mention either things that you have read and could work together, or things that you imagine would work. This is still an open problem so don’t be afraid to speak!
