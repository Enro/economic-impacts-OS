## Contingent value
Contingent value is equal to the hypothetical **willingness to pay** multiplied by number of users estimated on the basis of website visits.

## Cost–benefit analysis (CBA)
In a standard CBA, researchers sum up the identifiable existing or expected costs and benefits (converted to monetary terms) to which stakeholders in the system of interest are exposed to calculate the overall costs and benefits which accrue, and to whom. 

## Efficiency
Efficiency means getting the same output from research or innovation for less input (principally public research funding). For example, if open access publishing can be shown to allow access to research findings for the same number of researchers for a lower overall cost, this would represent an efficiency saving. While this review is not principally concerned with economic impacts within the university/publishing sector, such efficiencies are also relevant to wider economic impacts through improved returns to R&D.

## Enablement
Enablement signifies ways in which open science approaches have led to economically impactful activities which would have been less likely to occur in a closed environment.

## Solow–Swan model
The Solow–Swan model is a way of estimating the contribution of technological progress (driven by R&D) to economic growth. It can be used to estimate a return on investment in R&D through value to the economy in the coming years.

### Modified Solow–Swan model
The Solow–Swan model is modified to include consideration of the accessibility of R&D outputs (i.e., the extent to which they are available to inform technological progress) and efficiency with which R&D expenditure is converted into technological development (which could be potentially be improved by open science practices which help reduce redundancy or improve replicability). The modified model does not tell us anything about the real extent to which open science approaches could improve accessibility of efficiency (these are based on assumptions), but does provide an indication into what different levels of accessibility/efficiency improvement might mean for value in years to come.

## Wide ranging economic analysis of value to sectors such as education, healthcare and oil/gas
This analysis looks at issues such as, in the transportation sector, improved infrastructure planning and management, optimized fleet investment and better-informed consumer decision-making. 

## Willingness to pay/accept
Getting an accurate estimate of willingness to pay/accept from surveys can be difficult for reasons including respondents’ own difficulties in estimating value, incentives to obscure true value estimates, and mismatch between valuations and real purchasing behaviour.

### Willingness to accept
What payment they would accept for loss of access.

### Willingness to pay
What users would pay to retain access.
