## Contingent value
Contingent value is equal to the hypothetical **willingness to pay** multiplied by number of users estimated on the basis of website visits.

## Cost–benefit analysis (CBA)
In a standard CBA, researchers sum up the identifiable existing or expected costs and benefits (converted to monetary terms) to which stakeholders in the system of interest are exposed to calculate the overall costs and benefits which accrue, and to whom. 

## Efficiency
Efficiency means getting the same output from research or innovation for less input (principally public research funding). For example, if open access publishing can be shown to allow access to research findings for the same number of researchers for a lower overall cost, this would represent an efficiency saving. Such efficiencies are also relevant to wider economic impacts through improved returns to R&D.

## Enablement
Enablement signifies ways in which open science approaches have led to economically impactful activities which would have been less likely to occur in a closed environment.

## Research productivity

Three main frameworks can be used to define research productivity:
1. Scientometric framework. Research productivity is studied as the ratio of research inputs (e.g. funding and human capital) to knowledge codified in bibliographical outputs (publications and patents).
2. Innovation framework. Research productivity is studied as the ratio of research inputs (e.g. funding and human capital) to innovation outputs (e.g. technologies, patents and ideas).
3. Societal impact framework. Research productivity is studied as the relationship between research inputs, how they are organised and prioritised, and their effects on society.

### Factors hindering research productivity

1. inefficient R&D routines: innovation processes and routines have changed substantially over time and vary across sectors; as new technologies and new organisations emerge, R&D processes need to adapt
2. market pressures that drive innovation away from social welfare
3. R & D incentives that do not promote high-risk research: aside from market pressure, several policies shape innovation incentives in ways that are not aligned with radical innovations or innovations for the public good
4. fast-expanding endless frontier of new knowledge needed for innovations: new knowledge is essential for innovation, but as the frontier expands new knowledge is more difficult to achieve and more investments and talents are needed
5. difficulties in combining different areas of knowledge: although innovation is a process of knowledge recombination, and radical innovations tend to emerge from the combination of more different knowledge components, such combinations are risky and are increasingly difficult to produce.

## Solow–Swan model
The Solow–Swan model is a way of estimating the contribution of technological progress (driven by R&D) to economic growth. It can be used to estimate a return on investment in R&D through value to the economy in the coming years.

### Modified Solow–Swan model
The Solow–Swan model is modified to include consideration of the accessibility of R&D outputs (i.e., the extent to which they are available to inform technological progress) and efficiency with which R&D expenditure is converted into technological development (which could be potentially be improved by open science practices which help reduce redundancy or improve replicability). The modified model does not tell us anything about the real extent to which open science approaches could improve accessibility of efficiency (these are based on assumptions), but does provide an indication into what different levels of accessibility/efficiency improvement might mean for value in years to come.

## Wide ranging economic analysis of value to sectors such as education, healthcare and oil/gas
This analysis looks at issues such as, in the transportation sector, improved infrastructure planning and management, optimized fleet investment and better-informed consumer decision-making. 

## Willingness to pay/accept
Getting an accurate estimate of willingness to pay/accept from surveys can be difficult for reasons including respondents’ own difficulties in estimating value, incentives to obscure true value estimates, and mismatch between valuations and real purchasing behaviour.

### Willingness to pay
What users would pay to retain access. Measuring users’ willingness to pay can underestimate the value they attach to a service where those users are quite resource constrained.

### Willingness to accept
What payment users would accept for loss of access. In sectors where funding is relatively scarce, it is more instructive to focus on users’ willingness to accept payment for lack of access, which has no resource constraints.
